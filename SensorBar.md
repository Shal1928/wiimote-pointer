# Sensor Bar #

You can make your own USB sensor bar joining eight infrared LEDs and an USB cable. Thus, we first selected the appropriate LEDs for mounting. In our case we used high luminosity infrared LEDs, in order to avoid interference problems with other light sources or the distance of the Wiimote to the bar.

These LEDs are polarized at about 1.3 V, and have a current demand of around 100 mA. Given this situation, we checked that the USB is ideal for the task, providing 5 V and a max current of 500 mA, so we propose the following assembly:

With this configuration, each LED will be polarized to 1.25 V and supplied enough power to light properly.

From theory to practice. Now we need to assemble each end of the bar, where the four LEDs will position similar to the original bar:

Given that each LED has an opening angle of 50°, this position will make the points of infrared light visible from an angle of more than 100°, obtaining a radiation diagram as the following :

This will allow free movement in front of the screen to the person that is interacting with the program.

Finally, we link the two ends of the bar to the USB cable, freeing data cables, and fix everything, getting our home-made infrared bar:
